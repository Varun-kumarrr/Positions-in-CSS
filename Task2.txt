1. Relative Positioning
An element with position: relative is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
The element still occupies space in the normal flow, but its position can be shifted using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
If no top, right, bottom, or left properties are applied, the element remains in its original place.
Key Points:

The element's original space in the layout is preserved.
Useful for making small adjustments while keeping the element within the flow.

2. Absolute Positioning
An element with position: absolute is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
If there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the <html> (root element).
The element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it does not reserve space and other elements behave as if it doesn't exist.
Key Points:

The element is completely independent of its original position in the document flow.
Useful for placing elements in specific locations
